Minimal quick start guide in order to get a working version of gimp on OSX.
================================================ 

Notation:
The dollar sign precedes any terminal commands.

Please note that this is not a flawless process, and there are a few issues that still 
need to be fixed. If you have any questions, please ask them in #gimp on irc.gimp.org
or on the GIMP developer mailing list (see http://www.gimp.org/mail_lists.html)

I. Preparations
---------------------
1. Remove all traces of any previous Macports, Homebrew, or JHBuild installations.

2. Backup "~/.profile" for a fresh start:
$ if [ -f $HOME/.profile ]; \
   then \
     mv $HOME/.profile $HOME/.profile-bak \
    fi

3. Get XCode for your OS X version from the App Store. 
    Its installation takes some time. Use it to dig out some calming music. You will need it ;-)
    Note that OS X doesn't provide XCode for many older platforms. 
    Check the directory /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs
    to see the minimum target OS X version you are able to build for. 
    Apple requires you to get an Apple Developer Id to get XCode for older
    platforms if needed.  
    
4. Most OS X installations come with preinstalled Git. If you do not have Git installed, 
    then download a prebuilt binary from http://git-scm.com/download
    
5. Download and install the JHBuild build setup for OS X:
$ cd $HOME
$ curl -O https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
$ chmod +x gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
$ sh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

6. Add the JHBuild install directory to your $PATH and ~/.profile
$ export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' > $HOME/.profile

7. Download a custom JHBuild files for gimp
$ curl -o $HOME/.jhbuildrc-gimp https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/jhbuildrc-gimp?h=gimp-2-8 && 
   curl --create-dirs -o $HOME/gimp/directory/gimp.modules https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/gimp.modules?h=gimp-2-8

8. In order to create GIMP.app you'll need to download and install gtk-mac-bundler:
$ cd $HOME/gimp/10.6/source/
$ git clone https://github.com/jralls/gtk-mac-bundler.git
$ cd gtk-mac-bundler/
$ make install

II. Download and build GIMP
----------------------------------------
1. Now you can download and install GIMP, where 'gimp' is the directory prefix, and 
'10.6' is the minimum version you are building GIMP for. As it stands, you should be 
able to leave the values as they are, except XCode on your computer doesn't let
you build for older versions.
$ JHB=gimp GIMP_SDK=10.6 jhbuild bootstrap

This process requires some manual intervention, see the next steps. 

2. When the build fails on cmake, you can ignore this. GIMP and its dependencies
don't need it.
 
3. When the build fails on perl-xml-parser, it will  tell you that it can neither make 
nor install.
In this case open a new shell and complete the install:
$ JHB=gimp GIMP_SDK=10.6 jhbuild shell
$ cd $HOME/gimp/10.6/source/XML-Parser-[parser version here]
$ make -j3
$ make -j3 install

After finishing that change back into the first shell, choose option 2 to ignore 
the error because you just fixed it. At the error during phase install enter '2' again.

4. Do the same for the package perl-xml-simple:
$ cd ~/gimp/10.6/source/XML-Simple-[simple version here]
$ make -j3
$ make -j3 install

5. Now you can build GIMP.
For GIMP 2.8 enter
$ JHB=gimp GIMP_SDK=10.6 jhbuild build gimp-2.8

For GIMP master enter
$ JHB=gimp GIMP_SDK=10.6 jhbuild build gimp-master

6. If you would like the GTK Murrine theme, you can install it as well
# JHB=gimp GIMP_SDK=10.6 jhbuild build murrine-engine

7. In order to run GIMP with D-Bus support (required for GVFS and GIO)
$ dbus-launch gimp-2.8

This will generate a D-Bus session. If you continuously run GIMP using this method, 
you will end up with many D-Bus sessions being run. Kill them after all GIMP
instances have been killed. 

III. Create a GIMP installer
-------------------------------------
1. To create a bundle, we need some more files:
$ curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/gimp-2.8-python.bundle https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/gimp-2.8-python.bundle?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/launcher-2.8-python.sh https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/launcher-2.8-python.sh?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  chmod +x $HOME/gimp/directory/launcher-2.8-python.sh &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/info-2.8-python.plist https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/info-2.8-python.plist?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/gimp.icns https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/gimp.icns?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/xcf.icns https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/xcf.icns?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl --create-dirs -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/fonts.conf https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/fonts.conf?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/gimp.desktop https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/gimp.desktop?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/gimprc https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/gimprc?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/gtkrc https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/gtkrc?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/mimeinfo.cache https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/mimeinfo.cache?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/open.desktop https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/open.desktop?h=gimp-2-8 &&
  curl -o $HOME/gimp/directory/custom/session.conf https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/build/osx/custom/session.conf?h=gimp-2-8


2. We also need to fix a few outstanding issues:
$ cp $HOME/gimp/10.6/source/gettext-0.18.1.1/gettext-tools/intl/charset.alias ~/gimp/10.6/inst/lib
$ chmod +w $PREFIX/lib/libpython2.7.dylib

3. Run the bundler:
$ cd $HOME/gimp/directory
$ gtk-mac-bundler gimp-2.8-python.bundle
